## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Blockchain technology has emerged as a popular approach for secure and decentralized data storage. However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before it can become a mainstream solution for data storage. One of the most significant challenges is scalability, which makes it difficult to store large amounts of data quickly. Additionally, the cost of storage, interoperability, data privacy, and regulatory compliance are other significant challenges that need to be addressed.

Despite these challenges, blockchain technology continues to evolve, and ongoing research and development are being done to improve its scalability and address other challenges. As blockchain technology matures, it is likely that it will become more widely adopted for data storage, especially in industries where data security and transparency are critical. With further innovation and adoption, blockchain technology could revolutionize the way we store, manage, and share data in the future.
