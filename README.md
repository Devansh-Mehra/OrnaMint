## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Blockchain technology has emerged as a popular approach for secure and decentralized data storage. However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before it can become a mainstream solution for data storage. One of the most significant challenges is scalability, which makes it difficult to store large amounts of data quickly. Additionally, the cost of storage, interoperability, data privacy, and regulatory compliance are other significant challenges that need to be addressed.
Despite these challenges, blockchain technology continues to evolve, and ongoing research and development are being done to improve its scalability and address other challenges. As blockchain technology matures, it is likely that it will become more widely adopted for data storage, especially in industries where data security and transparency are critical. With further innovation and adoption, blockchain technology could revolutionize the way we store, manage, and share data in the future.  

## IDEA
The proposed project aims to offer a convenient and secure platform for users to manage their financial data. By integrating with the Ethereum blockchain, users can log in using their Ethereum account, providing a secure and decentralized login method. The platform will enable users to upload pictures of their bills and photos of products, and through advanced data extraction techniques, the platform will extract data from the bills to create a record of their financial transactions. This data will then be stored securely on a decentralized platform, which ensures that the information is tamper-proof and easily accessible to users whenever they need it.
Moreover, by using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), users can view their financial data in a more visual and user-friendly manner. Each financial transaction will be represented as a unique NFT, and users can track their financial data through a simple and intuitive user interface. This will enable users to have a better understanding of their financial transactions and make more informed decisions about their finances. Overall, this project will empower users to take control of their financial data and provide a secure and user-friendly platform for managing their finances.


## ARCHITECTURE
Our website allows users to register or log in and easily add new data by clicking the "add" button at the bottom of the screen. The uploaded data is displayed in the user's profile page, which also shows the history of all uploaded data.

When a user uploads a photo of their bill, our artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithm extract the data from the bill, which is then presented to the user for verification. Once the user confirms the accuracy of the extracted data, they can upload additional details such as price and photos of the product before submitting it.

To ensure security, the uploaded data and images are encrypted and stored on IPFS, with a unique CID recorded in a smart contract. This generates a unique NFT for the data, which serves as a digital ownership certificate for the bill and is visible to the user in the website's front-end.

Our website also allows users to easily search through their uploaded data by entering relevant information in the search bar.
